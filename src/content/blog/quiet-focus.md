Attention is fragile. I treat it like an instrument that needs to be tuned daily.

A few small constraints help:

- Fewer tabs open than I want.
- A single, clear question at the top of my notes.
- A physical timer so time is visible.

When attention is protected, the work tends to be calmer and more precise.

Great work shows up when the system is steady enough to hold it.

A few habits that keep me grounded:

- Start with a short list and a long horizon.
- Protect the first hour with no meetings, no pings.
- Close the loop at the end of the day. Write down what is still open.

These are simple guardrails, but they turn creative work from a sprint into a repeatable practice.
